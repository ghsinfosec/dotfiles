Current neovim and tmux setup.

Most of this configuration came from Josean Martinez [@josean-dev](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files). I really liked his setup so I did what anyone else would do and copied it without any effort of my own other than excluding things I didn't need and changing the colorsceheme :)

His YouTube playlist can be found [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnu5gT9QrFg36OehOdECFvxFFeMHhb_07). There are a few things that need to be updated and reconfigured as some of the plugins no longer work the way they did in his initial videos.
